                    when embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion

                    Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                    individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted".     Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields

                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
